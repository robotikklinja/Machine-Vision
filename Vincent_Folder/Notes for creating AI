This AI is going to be used to play KrypKasino. It will take inputs based on the code that uses OpenCV to determine what cards to play.

The AI should use one of two techniques:
    Reinforcement Learning (RL), a reward system that rewards the AI upon making a good move, and punishes the AI upon making a bad move.
    Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), which is a technique that is used in more complex games like Chess or Poker. It simulates possible moves and evaluates their outcomes.

1. Make the game logic
    How many cards there are present, how many players are playing in addition to the AI, what actions are possible.

2. Make the AI logic
    Use either RL or MCTS.

3. Train and test the AI
