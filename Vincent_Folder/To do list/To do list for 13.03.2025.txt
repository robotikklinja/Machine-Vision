To do for 13.03.2025

    Display what cards make up what combo when playing a card in a simulated play

    Display a score for every card in the combo (the card that you would get) in the simulation
        (cardcombos function)

    Compare the scores to each other

    Make the best play the move that gives the CPU the least amount of points

    Announce that move and try to put that so that the ModBus can get that move as an input it can use
