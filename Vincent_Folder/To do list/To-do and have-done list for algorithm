To-do and have-done list for algorithm

1. Make game logic (here as of 23.01.2025)
    
    I. (Done)
    Import libraries. Make classes for cards in the hand and on the table.
    
    II. (Done)
    Store all the card objects to either the hand or the table class via an array
    of strings of the card objects. Then set their location to the hand or the table.
    Also make it so the code raises an error if the robot has more than 4 cards in its hand
        
    III. (Done)
    Create class Cardrule to identify the arrays of cards from the table or hand to assign a value to it.

    IV. (Done)
    Create dictionaries for the card values and assign the values of the cards depending
    on if a card is on the table or in the hand.

2. Make the actual algorithm to make the decision

    I. (WIP)
    Create some kind of simple decision making for the algorithm

    II.
    Work on making it better
