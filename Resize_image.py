"""
This code is going to resize an image so that it can be campared later.
There is a image witch has the correct dimensions and can be compared visually

To resize to the correct size you must add the width and the height separately 
All the refference images must be the same size and dimensions.

Since we use two different reference sizes, one for number and one for suit
there are two functions. 

Use of the worng function can happen and for unknown resize it's own function must be made.
