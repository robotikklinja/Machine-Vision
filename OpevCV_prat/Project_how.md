# CardDetector

## General Informasion

On how we will do the project it make parts of the code individually
and combine the codes in to one code.

### Testing

To test the individual part of the whole there should be a reference to 
the output so that reason can do the rest.


## How to make the code?

### Step 1

Make the camera work through a python code by using OpenCV.

The camera that shall be in use on Step 1 is the camera on the PC,
but the camera that is going to be used futher is curently unknown. 
It maybe be a USB camera, PiRaspberry or something else.
In the worst case it is going to be the one on the PC.

### Step 2:

Make a program that sees if there are any cards on the table or as the program sees it rectangles. 

This is going to be done by using OpenCV.
This can be done by bluring, graying and shresholding combined 
so that the pixels that are left are only in black and white.


### Step 3:

After the code sees the card it shall store the image and compare it 
with the other stored reference images of the other cards. 

To compare the reference image and the card on the table. 

The reference images are just images of the numbers and suts in the corner of the card in black and white!

### Step 4:



### Step 5:

A Camera shall be placed on the edge of the table so that the UR5 is on.
The Camera that i shall use in the main camera on my PC to see the cards on the table.
The Camera should see the table witch is where the playing cards are going to be placed on.
